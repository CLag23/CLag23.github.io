            <p> On this page, I will walk you through my experience gardening for the first time. 
                I will discuss the times or seasons I started gardening, where I planted my plants, 
                the tools and materials I used, and why I decided to start gardening.

            <h2>Season</h2>
            <p>
                The best time to start gardening in the U.S. is in spring, which is what I did. 
                This is when the soil begins to warm up and the days start getting longer. 
                Additionally, many vegetables, herbs, and flowers thrive when planted after the last frost.

        <section id="location" class="page" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>
                Choosing the right location to start my garden was one of the most important steps for its success. 
                I decided to plant my garden in my backyard because it receives 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight, 
                has good access to water making watering easy, is protected from harsh winds, and is easily 
                accessible for me to tend to my plants.

            <h2>How Did I Start</h2>
            <p>
                There are many gardening styles to choose from, depending on your space, budget, and goals. 
                Some popular styles include traditional in-ground gardening, raised bed gardening, container gardening, 
                vertical gardening, and hydroponic gardening. I chose to create a raised bed garden using the square foot method 
                because it is beginner-friendly, easy to access, and allows for better control over weeds and pests. 
                To start my garden, I used a variety of tools and materials, including gardening gloves, 
                a measuring tape, a pencil, a shovel, a saw, a drill, lumber, soil, compost, and string.

        <section id="why" class="page" style="display: none;">
            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>
                I decided to start gardening for several reasons. First, I wanted to learn how to grow my own fresh and healthy produce, 
                which is often more nutritious and flavorful than store-bought options. Second, I was inspired by a relative who had 
                years of experience in gardening and generously shared their knowledge and passion with me. Finally, I wanted to find something 
                new to do during the summer, and gardening seemed like an enjoyable activity that doesn‚Äôt require too much maintenance if set up correctly.
