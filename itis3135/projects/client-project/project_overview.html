        <h2>Page Design</h2>
        <p><b>Home Page</b> - Introduces the website and helps users navigate to main sections like Login, What is Python, How It’s Used, and Contact Support. It doesn’t collect data; users click buttons to access other pages.</p>
        <p><b>Login Page</b> - Lets registered users sign in using a username and password. It includes validation for required fields and redirects successful logins to the Menu page.</p>
        <p><b>Menu Page</b> - Serves as the dashboard after login, providing links to learning modules such as What is Python, How It’s Used, Set Up Environment, and Contact Support. It doesn’t require user input.</p>
        <p><b>Python Page</b> - Explains what Python is through sections like Definition, Basic Concepts, and Code Examples. Users can click links to view explanations and examples without entering any data.</p>
        <p><b>How It’s Used Page</b> - Shows real-world applications of Python in areas like Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science. Users can click to explore each topic.</p>
        <p><b>Set Up Environment Page</b> - Guides beginners through installing Python, choosing a code editor, and using online environments. It includes external links to resources and tutorials but requires no input.</p>
        <p><b>Contact Support Page</b> - Gives users help options and includes a link to the Feedback form. It doesn’t collect data directly.</p>
        <p><b>Feedback</b> - A button that sends users to the form page</p>
        <p><b>Freedback form Form Page</b> - Collects user inquiries with fields for name, email, and message. It includes validation and buttons to submit, reset, or go back.</p>

        <h2>Dynamic Functionality</h2>
        <p>On the Login and Form pages, JavaScript will check that all fields are filled correctly before allowing users to submit. Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_validation.asp</p>
        <p>On the Set Up Environment page, a “Next Step” button will show each setup instruction one at a time, helping users follow along. Reference: https://www.freecodecamp.org</p>
        <p>On the How It’s Used page, clicking a topic like “Web Development” will expand or collapse additional details using JavaScript. Reference: https://www.linkedin.com</p>
